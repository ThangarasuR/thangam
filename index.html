        <p>Founded in 1999 by Matthew Spacie, Magic Bus is building a world where young people break out of poverty to lead fulfilling, rewarding lives and contribute positively to their communities. This is achieved by enabling adolescents to complete secondary education and skilling young people to be in jobs.

            Our Childhood to Livelihood programme works with adolescents and young people in the age group of 12 to 24 years. Over the past two decades, we have spread our reach across India and impacted more than 1 million young people across 24 states and 75 districts.
